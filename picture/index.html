    <p class="Text">Iceland is an island nation in the North Atlantic Ocean. The relief of the country is determined by volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Vatnajökull and Snaefellsjokull National Parks are located in Iceland and are known for their huge glaciers. Most of the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which receives a significant part of its energy from a geothermal power plant. In the city, it is worth visiting the National Museum and the Saga Museum, the exposition of which is dedicated to the history of the settlement of Iceland by the Vikings.
