        <div class="last-div">
            <p>Mestia in Georgia is a small urban-type settlement in the region of Upper Svaneti, in the north-west of the country. Located on the slope of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, it strikes the imagination already on the way to Georgia: from the window of the plane you can see small houses lost among the snow-capped mountain peaks. Mestia is worth a visit for lovers of beautiful landscapes, Svan culture and, of course, outdoor activities. It is from here that the climbing routes to the peaks of Ushba and Shkhelda begin, and there is a ski resort not far from the town.</p>
